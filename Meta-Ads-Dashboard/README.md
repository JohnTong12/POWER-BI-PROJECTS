# Meta Ads Performance Dashboard

![Meta Ads Performance Dashboard](Image/Image4.png)


I'm excited to share a **Meta Ads Performance Dashboard** I've built using a realistic Meta Ads dataset that mirrors how Facebook and Instagram advertising platforms capture and report campaign data.

The dataset includes detailed information on campaigns, ad creatives, user demographics (age, gender, location), and ad interaction events.

This interactive dashboard is designed to help marketing teams **analyze and optimize paid campaigns** across **Facebook** and **Instagram** by providing clear, actionable insights into key advertising KPIs.

## Project Objective

To track and evaluate the performance of advertising campaigns on Facebook and Instagram, offering visibility into:
- Reach & Impressions
- Engagement patterns
- Conversion funnel efficiency
- Budget utilization and ROI

This enables data-driven decisions to:
- Compare platform effectiveness (Facebook vs Instagram)
- Optimize budget allocation
- Identify high-performing audience segments
- Improve return on ad spend (ROAS)
